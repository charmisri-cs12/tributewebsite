      <p>
        APJ Abdul Kalam, also known as Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, was the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was a renowned aerospace scientist, engineer, and author who left an indelible mark on India's history. Born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India, Kalam's early life was marked by simplicity and hard work. He graduated in Physics from St. Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli, and later earned a degree in Aerospace Engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology. Kalam's career took off when he joined the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) in 1969, where he played a crucial role in the development of India's first satellite launch vehicle, SLV-3. His contributions to India's missile and space programs, including the development of the Agni and Prithvi missiles, earned him the nickname "Missile Man of India." In 2002, Kalam was elected as the 11th President of India, serving a five-year term, during which he became known as the "People's President" for his simplicity, humility, and connect with the common man.
